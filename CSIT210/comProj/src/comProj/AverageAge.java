// Overview: CSIT 210: LAB 2
// Objective: The following program reads three integers and prints the average. Write a Java program to calculate the average.
//Input: None
 //Output: Text Display * Variables: None
 //Plan:
// 1. [Step 1 Ex: User runs the program]
 //2. [Step 2 Ex: Hello World and the authorâ€™s name is displayed]

//@version: 1.0 1.27.2025

		System.out.print("Please enter the second age as an integer or whole number: ");
		val2 = scan.nextInt();                   //This obtains the second integer from the user.
		
		System.out.print("Please enter the third age as an integer or whole number: ");
		val3 = scan.nextInt();					//This obtains the third integer from the user.

		//Compute the average.
		average = (val1 + val2 + val3) / (3.0);      					  // This equation adds the user's three integers and divides by 3.0--------> In order to preserve the decimal places in the result, you must add at least one decimal value in the equation.
		System.out.print("The average is " + average + ".");           //  This prints the average on the screen.
